The Light That Never Fades
ChatGPT

Take me out tonight
Where the people and the music collide
In a world so young and alive
Driving in your car
I'll forget that I have no home
As long as I'm by your side

Take me out tonight
To see the world come alive
Let's drive around, no destination in sight
And in the dark underpass
I'll gather the courage to ask
To stay with you, through the night

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
Our love will never fade, of that I have no doubt
And if we're hit by a bus or a truck
I'd rather die with you, my dear luck

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, let's escape
I don't care, we'll make our own fate
And if I never find a home
I'll know I'm not alone

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
Our love will never fade, of that I have no doubt
And if we're hit by a bus or a truck
I'd rather die with you, my dear luck

There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
